# Python-lm-function
Does least squares based on R's lm() function, but entirely in Python.

Purpose is to apply statistics and linear algebra for solving formulas, rather than using an approach that requires directly repeating long formulas, that can be easily handled by matrices.

Subclass LQ_out handles actual output, while LeastSq applies linear regression.
